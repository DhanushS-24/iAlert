# iAlert: An Alert System Based on Eye Gaze on Patient Assistance
People in this fast-growing world will, knowingly or unknowingly, suffer from various kinds of accidents. It might be severe or moderate. In severe cases, some patients may not be able to move their limbs. This work provides an assistive system for patients who cannot move from one place to another and who have injuries to their limbs but are not limited to cases of accidents. In this scenario, the only means for the patient to communicate is through eye movement or blinking. Eye tracking uses numerous technological procedures to measure eye movements, locations, and points of gaze. The primary goal of this research is to establish a human-computer interface for patients by tracking eye movement with an open-source webcam. In case of any need for the patient, an alarm system is designed to notify or alert the caretaker. When the patient wants to communicate, the patient can make eye contact with the provided screen and then the caretaker will be notified. This low-cost eye tracking and eye gaze technology can be integrated into mobile phones and laptops, computers.
